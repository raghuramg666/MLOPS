# End-to-End MLOps Workflow

## Overview
This project demonstrates a robust MLOps pipeline integrated with a Flask-based interface for managing machine learning workflows. It incorporates best practices for continuous integration, continuous delivery (CI/CD), model versioning, and deployment.

---

## Features
- Modular MLOps architecture for efficient workflow management.
- Flask web interface for user interaction and monitoring.
- Integration of CI/CD pipelines for automated deployment.
- Reproducible workflows for training, evaluation, and deployment of machine learning models.

---

## Project Structure
- `FLASK/`: Contains the Flask application files for the web interface.
- `mlops/`: Includes core MLOps pipeline scripts and configurations.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists all required Python dependencies for the project.

---

## Requirements
To set up and run the project, you will need:
- Python 3.8 or above
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)
- Required Python libraries (listed in `requirements.txt`)

---

## Setup and Usage

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd MLOPS-main
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Install the required libraries:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the Flask Application
Navigate to the Flask folder and start the application:
```bash
cd FLASK
python app.py
```

### 4. Access the Web Interface
